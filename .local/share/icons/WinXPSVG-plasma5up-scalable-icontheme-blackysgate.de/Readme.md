 can´t say anything "Jeppaaa" but the
dammn Linux-System feeelll soooooo gooooddd,


so then there for Linux ,

 have FuN Folk´s


by the way, If you make a fresh, new Icontheme and and Mimetypes and you make a own File/Letter-Picture als Mimetype, can you use this Resource for the
Filetypelogos with the Logos from this Project in to your Mimetypes, why a hugh search in the net,
if there exist all need Logos in my mimetypes.. edit, copy, past the 'logotypes' in your new File/Letter Picture...
full editable via inkscape or some other Vectoreditor as SVG-Picture.
So why not working together for have correct and nice Mymetypes in any Themes .. and realy : these black/white Icons makes Eyecancer !



<h2> Technical : </h2>
 

 ~ 3500 files (let count in the product-folder before packing 'find . -type f | wc -l')
 


  <h3>WinNT Icons for Wine, Reactos</h3>
 ... and so on, dll, ini, hosts and other icons, these be extra icons and
 need extra mime-registrations, therefor have i add a
 batchscript in this themefolder for adding extra Mimetype-regestration filetypes
 where  traditional not include in mimetypes of Linux, once because 'windowshate'
 other 'Linux is not windows' but at other side have we Wine,
 So why not add mimetypes for these extra files like dll, ini and so on and by side,
 marking with extra Icons, hosts, locale.conf and  other files in /etc like cfg,
 conf and so on, therefor have i make 27 or so extra Icons
 and add even just this batchfile for regging there filetypes for using extra icons,
 Edit addmimetouser.sh, look it on and if the batchfile okey by you or for you,
 then open a konsole or xterm windows and execute it, behind you have make
 'chmod 750 addmimetouser.sh'
 then have you extra icons and the theme supports the Winnt, sys, dll, cpl icons
 in/by this theme  (or my NT themes where i have collected)
 and your wine is therewith also a bit supportet with the right icons.
 So, manny fun by look beyond the horizon of the Linux only Icons ;)
 By the way, this svg-Iconthemes can you also use for Reactos...
 

<h3>Links, link-icons (so symlinks) in KDE/Plasma Icontheme</h3>
  [iconname].svg is linked to ./../subdirectory/[iconname].svg where is able for
  selecting via 'ln -s -f [./ or ./../dirname][iconname][-01/05].svg [Iconname].svg'
  therewith have you a possibile for selecting other link-logo/icon by side and select it via change the linked link,
  would be nice, if there a Selectingprogramm for, or in KDE/Plasma an own small Tweakprogramm in QT 



  *Important !!:* 
  Select an other Icontheme and let reload all icons, then change to the KristalSVG back for reset the 'Link icon' in the System if you have change it for fully reset the iconcache, was in early KDE Times like so, is totay also like this...the cache must fully reset by changing the link icon.
  

  

  <h3> - Symbolic</h3>
  The First Symbolic Icons blubbblubb-symbolic.svg was startet with ./../places/folder-symbolic.svg
  for make Symbolic Icons for use with Konqueror-Sidepanel, NOT for changing Size to small Icons via slider
  and use an OTHER-Themed black white Icons, nope, was a Iconic Icon of the actual Folder Icons for better Display the small Folders,
  like in Explorer from MS.
  The whole Icons in black-white form is not theme-conform and scares others away from making iconsthemes, really, and don't needs,
  makes only more work and boring the Icon-Buliders for make doublework !
  ONLY in Places the Folder Icons as Iconic, for use more smaller Icons in (now) Dolphin and Konqueror to have more smaller icons in the Sidepanel,
  iconic icons, more not !
  Like i told, double-work is bad and the normal Icons be alreaddy Icons for small see..
  If you want an other Icontheme, then use some Icontheme an other is a mix of 2 Iconthemes HighContrast and Breeze,
  looking to Breeze-Project 8| :\ , the whole blackwite in apps,actions,status AND SO ON ! be really -not right- placed
  and belongs only to the Folders as Symbolic Icons, other is bullsc... ! And you should use really an other Icontheme !
  Therewith could disclassed Breeze as master template because they kick to much and in a wrong way small icons as -symbolic,
  because they don't known what's meant with -symbolic icons.. and it should be alone in /places for the Symbolic Sidepanel-Folders.
  Because hold short and not overgrown..

  have a pulldownmenu for Themeusers or by side a Fileselector-Button for use an own Photo/Picture
  at the Userconfiguration.

  <h3>Support for 3 Layer Folder for let view the Preview into the Folder and not in front ..</h3>
  

  * Layer one , the back of the Folder inode-directory-back.svg
  * Layer 2 The Preview of the Folderfiles

  * Fallback inode-directory.svg  for hold the Compatibility for more older Themes.
  

  <h3> Support for Filesystem Drive Harddrive FS Name onto the Drives and umount</h3>
    

  * You Frend is not only 'fstab', 'mtab' also, because mtab display the mounted Drives
  

    this should also take for read out from the hang in device and the filesystem,
    then become you also the FS from this drive-harddisk and can name it like
    the most common filesystem.. if the drive-harddisk-[filesystem] + -umount
    (if not mounted in mtab, but in fstab for let show in /mnt or /media)
    exist, can work with it, look into the device-filder ;)  

  

  * Fallback drive-harddrive.svg and drive-harddrive-umount.svg if fs drive not exist or umounted
    but writed in fstab and mtab ... 

    Fallback drive-harddrive.svg + edit-delete-remove as overlay if *-umount not exist

  <h3>kdf</h3>
    

   * icon nfs.svg png is for let display the nfs-fs icon for this type into Kdf,
     therefore is in the 'devices' a link or a nfs.svg png
     into for resolution of dependency of the kdf Program.  

  

 </h4> Bugfixing Kde/Plasma : </h4>
   

     Therefor should the 'nfs' change and bugfixing and change to 'drive-network' picturename
  



 <h3> Systemsettings Fonts Managing</h3>
  

   Icon user-06.svg into apps is a Mandrake fellower ?!  

   or a really early picture selecting in Systemsettings
   and there was the name of the icon user-06 in Font 'user-fonts'  

  

 <h4> Bugfixing KDE/Plasma :</h4>
   

  * It should be replace icon user-06 to 'user' svg
  * Creating a new Picturecategory Userpicture and the folder /user
  * an own 'user' folder with standartnames of the userpictures for working with them like user, users, usergroup, sudo, 'user[-01/02/03]' and 'defaultuser' picture as svg/png/xpm/bmp,jpg and so on.. therewith it is possible for storing in clean form the whole userpictures as the poples whant kicked in ;)
  

  <h3> Support for Netfilesystems, so '-network-' FS Samba and NFS</h3>
  

  you're Frend is your fstab & mtab ( i use it use it with my Notebook as desktop-Link and a nfs mount script
  where let check's if the nfs mounted or umounted and i let change the nfs-icon on my nfx.desktop file directly with the script.., my Username and kdesu
  for let as sudo-user hang in or umount the nfs-drives and   let change the drives-nfs* icons on my desktop.
  Why can Plasma this not do ???? Now be the Icons existand and usable, so....  

  

  * drive-network-nfs + drive-network-nfs-umount (check the mtab, exist in fstab and if is mounted)
  * drive-network-smb + drive-network-smb-umount (check the mtab, exist in fstab and if is mounted)
  * drive-network-apfs + drive-network-apfs-umount (check the mtab, exist in fstab and if is mounted)
  * Fallback drive-network.svg and drive-network-umount.svg if fs drive icon not exist for hold the Compatibility for more older Themes.
  

  Why only 'network' and not net, because hold it at the iconnames standart .. drive-network-[fs]
  

  

  Would nice, if at the 2024 Millienium it possible for support something
  like FS-spezific Drive icons, mtab+fstab mounted icons and 3 Layer Folder Preview where is in the middle the preview.  !  
  

   best to the QT Plasma Code Hackers ;)  

  


<h2> Comercial Things </h2>
  

 * Adversiting for free ! and hold in the speech .. and this for free ..   

 Because the Factorylogos in the Fileicons, to all your Commercial Peoples and Factorys,
 don't forget, all Displaying your Logos and Icons be pure adversiting for free ...
 Since the factory logos in the file icons remind you of all your businessmen and factories,
 don't forget that displaying your logos and icons is purely free advertising for/in the open source community.
 Sending a lawyer against this seems like an idiot and a stupid reaction,
 I would say, you would make an cut in the own flesh and you put yourself on the sidelines.
 So, support a bit the Open Source Community and let do a little advertising for your company for free ;)  

  

 Because LGPL and other Rights, if a couples Icons from others in there, stay these unter the same Copyright like it was before.
 But the Icons what i have made and the Date from this icontheme, stay all unter CC0 and is free usable for all of the World (and forbidden to sell and make money with it!),
 like The Replica Icons where i have make out of PNG's for have pure SVG-Icons, Layers, fingers away, it's for the Community, also for you also for free, so .
 Alone KDE.org can deside about the Copyright at last and under what for a Copyright it stand but in my will, CC0 for end of the Worldtime ;).
 But hold in the Mind, all changed Icons be a new icon and no more a Orginal, and therewith no more orginal owner.. And stay under European/German Law
 This Icons should be for all who use Linux, Reactos and under GPL'ed Ordering System, not for sale, only for gift !

best
Blacky
